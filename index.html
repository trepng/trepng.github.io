<h4> What is Baby Oil?</h4>
<p>Baby oil is a gentle, mineral oil-based product primarily used for moisturizing and soothing the skin. Originally formulated for infants, its hypoallergenic properties make it suitable for people of all ages, effectively locking in moisture and preventing dryness. Beyond its moisturizing benefits, baby oil is also commonly used as a massage oil, providing a smooth glide that enhances relaxation. Additionally, it serves as an effective makeup remover and can help reduce friction in various applications. While generally safe, it’s important to perform a patch test for sensitivities and avoid using it on diaper rashes, as it may trap moisture. Overall, baby oil remains a versatile and affordable option for skincare and personal care routines.</p>
<h2>Baby Oil Uses</h2>
The events that led to Diddy's arrest began after a confrontation inside the nightclub. Witnesses claimed that a fight broke out between Combs' entourage and other patrons, which escalated when shots were fired. Three people were injured during the incident, sparking chaos inside the club. Police quickly responded, and P. Diddy, Lopez, and rapper Shyne (a member of Diddy's entourage) were arrested as suspects in the investigation.
